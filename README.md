# Work on the project

It is highly rcommended to use `yarn` as package manager in this project.
So at first before clone and start developing and enjoy the project, insure that you have the `yarn` installed with your node package manage`npm`.

**Note : We will ignore `package-lock.json` in project to avoid possible conflicts between yarn and npm. but `yarn.lock` will be included in project.**

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install` instead of `npm install`

If you use yarn to manage the packages of the project to initialize the project and install required packages run `yarn install` after cloning the project source.
Instead of using `yarn install` you can use `npm install`. This act like `yarn install`.
As we say in the past it is recommended to use `yarn` instead of `npm`, but it is an option to start contribute in project with us.


### `yarn start` instead of `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test` instead of `npm test` or `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build` instead of `npm build` or `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject` instead of `npm eject` or `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
